Changes Since Iteration 3:

 - Updated arrows to be more responsive and on time with the rhythm of the song.
 - Updated menu to have several options to choose from.
 - Updated song to have a pause in order to not be thrown right into the game too fast.
 - Manipulated song speed slightly in order to match arrow speed throughout the song.
